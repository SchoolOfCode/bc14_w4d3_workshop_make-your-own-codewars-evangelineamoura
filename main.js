Oh no! Rupunzilla is trapped in a tower! She's not going to let you climb up her hair because she quite likes keeping it on her head, so you are going to have to try something else if you want to save her! 

Luckily for you the witch that trapped her kept a list of all the people and things she has in the various towers under her control. You must enter the magical code that frees Rupunzilla. Make sure that you return the phrase "I found Rupunzilla in tower " and enter the index where you found her. 

e.g:
["stockpile of cheese", "winter socks", "Brianna", "5 tiny elves", "that one shopkeeper who wouldn't sell me any bananas because she 'didn't have any!'", "Rupunzilla", "a bunch of paperclips", "pointy shoes"] 

Would return "I found Rupunzilla in tower 5"
